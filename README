               SWScroller - Simple text scroller like star wars

Thank you for downloading SWScroller - Simple text scroller like star wars.
The idea of this program is to make a simple star wars like text, adding a file for music presentation. 
So you can use an .ogg file with this scroller and a simple text file to make a presentation.

Among with this idea, is also the use of different libraries and tools for c++. So we have a program that uses :

* Simple logging with ofstream
* Use of gstreamer library so we can use .ogg files to listen to music
* Use of FreeGlut glutStrokeCharacter function to draw simple font on the screen
* Use of STL library for a simple list
* Comment the code for doxygen documentation

Freeglut on Debian / Ubuntu : freeglut libraries and source code
****************************************************************
run this code on the command line : 

sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev

Xfree 86 (some systems need it)
***************************************
run this code on the command line :

link it :

g++ -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gstreamer-1.0 -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include -o swscroller swscroller.o  -pthread -I/usr/include/libmount -I/usr/include/blkid -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/glib-2.0/include -lgthread-2.0 -pthread -lgio-2.0 -lgobject-2.0 -lglib-2.0 -lglut -lGL -lGLU -lXxf86vm -lgobject-2.0 -lgstreamer-1.0


DOCUMENTATION
=============
In order to create a full documentation doxygen like, you must install it:

sudo apt-get install doxygen

and then run this command line on the same folder to create a full .HTML documentation for the software:
